•	focusing on the classification of EEG motor imagery data. The project was conducted using a vast dataset from Kaggle, which can be accessed at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aymanmostafa11/eeg-motor-imagery-bciciv-2a/code .
•	     Developed a machine learning project to classify EEG data, involving data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, model training and evaluation.
•	    Created a GUI application using Flutter to predict and control the movement of an image based on the trained Random Forest model's predictions.
